* Multi-factor authentication (MFA): It adds only a few seconds to your day but makes a huge difference to your account’s security. Set up MFA and use an authenticator app to verify that it’s really you logging in to your Nord Account. 
* Refer a friend: Know someone who’s not using NordVPN for online protection yet? Invite them to sign up with your unique referral link, and both get 1 month free. The more friends you refer, the more free months of service you get to enjoy! </d1p1:Description><d1p1:SetupPath>C:\Users\Bruker\AppData\Local\NordVPN\Updates\channel-33\6.37.5.0\macntiov.exe</d1p1:SetupPath><d1p1:Title>The new and even better NordVPN 6.38.15 is here.
